## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

# Provably Random Raffle Contracts

## About

This code is to create a provably random smart contract lottery.

## What we want it to do?

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
1. The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw
1. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner
1. And this will be done programatically
1. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation
1. Chainlink VRF -> Randomness
1. Chainlink Automation -> Time based trigger

## Tests!

1. Write some deploy scripts
2. Write our tests
   1. Work on a local chain
   2. Forked Testnet
   3. Forked Mainnet
